For Open Access Dataset

The KUH_Functional_connectivity folder contains data on the functional connectivity of an epilepsy patient's preictal EEG signal, as calculated from their mood.

The data flattens the adjacency matrix of all coherence's FCs, with the row names indicating the weight between each channel.

The folder also includes code for graph analysis using FC of coherence.
